Pennsylvania elected seven Federalist and sixteen Democratic-Republicans to the Fourteenth Congress.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 1, which elected four members, and Districts 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10, which each elected two members. The votes cast in Warren County are included in the Venango County totals.
