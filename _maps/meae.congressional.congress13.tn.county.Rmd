Tennessee elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Thirteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Following the 1810 Census, Tennessee gained three more seats in the House of Representatives.

Tennessee used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1814, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:tn.special.congress.5.1814) was held in which Newton Cannon was elected to replace Felix Grundy, who had resigned.
