Delaware elected one Federalist to the Eleventh Congress.

Delaware used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress. Delaware’s election law required that voters select two candidates, with one residing in the voter’s own county, and the other residing in one of the state's other two counties. The at-large winner was elected.
