North Carolina elected twelve Democratic-Republicans to the Ninth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the county level.

North Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1805, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nc.uscongress5.specialelection.1805) was held in which Democratic-Republican Thomas Kenan was elected to replace James Gillespie, who died while in office.

In 1806, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nc.uscongress10.special.1806) was held in which Evan Alexander was elected to replace Nathaniel Alexander, who had resigned after being elected as the Governor of North Carolina.
