Virginia elected one Federalist, nineteen Democratic-Republicans, and two other Republicans who were part of a faction within the party to the Ninth Congress. The Republican faction in this election was the Tertium Quids (or just Quids), a coalition of Federalists and moderate Democratic-Republicans. The Quids were led by John Randolph of Roanoke, who won election from the Fifteenth District.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the county level.

Virginia used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1806, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:va.uscongress.13.special.1806) was held in which Democrat William A. Burwell was elected to replace Christopher Clark, who had resigned from office to practice law.
