Georgia elected four Democratic-Republicans to the Twelfth Congress.

Georgia used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.

In 1812, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ga.uscongress.special.1812) was held in which William Barnett was elected to replace Howell Cobb, who had resigned from office.
