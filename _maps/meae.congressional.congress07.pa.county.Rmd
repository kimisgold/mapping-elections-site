Pennsylvania elected three Federalists and ten Democratic-Republicans to the Seventh Congress.

Pennsylvania continued to use a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 4, which elected two members.

In 1801, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:pa.uscongress4.1801) was held in which Democratic-Republican Issac Van Horne was elected to replace Peter Muhlenberg, who had resigned from office after his election to the U.S. Senate.

In 1801, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:pa.uscongress8.specialelection.1801) was held in which Democratic-Republican John Steward was elected to replace Thomas Hartley, who died while in office.
