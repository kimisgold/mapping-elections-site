Pennsylvania elected six Federalists and twelve Democratic-Republicans to the Eleventh Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in some areas.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 4, which elected two members, and Districts 1, 2, and 3, which each elected three members. The votes cast in Warren County are included in the Venango County totals. 

In 1809, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:pa.uscongress1.specialelection.1809) was held in which Democratic-Republican Adam Seybert was elected to replace Benjamin Say, who had resigned from office.
