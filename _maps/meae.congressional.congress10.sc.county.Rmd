South Carolina elected eight Democratic-Republicans to the Tenth Congress.

South Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1807, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.newberry.specialelection.1807) was held in which Joseph C. Calhoun was elected to replace Levi Casey, who died while in office.
