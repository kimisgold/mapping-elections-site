Maryland elected three Federalists and six Democratic-Republicans to the Sixteenth Congress. In the 8th district, Thomas Bayly, although listed as a Federalist, received support from both parties.

Maryland used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 5, which elected two members.
