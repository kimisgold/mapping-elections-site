Rhode Island elected two Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Both of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay.

Rhode Island used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.

Rhode Island’s election law allowed voters to cast two ballots, and required candidates to receive a majority of votes to be elected. Since two candidates did not receive the required majority in the general election, on November 25, 1825 a [runoff ballot](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ri.uscongress1.1825) elected Dutee J. Pearce to Rhode Island’s second seat.
