Tennessee elected three Democratic-Republicans to the Eighth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the county level.

Following the 1800 Census, Tennessee gained two seats in the House of Representatives.

Tennessee used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.
