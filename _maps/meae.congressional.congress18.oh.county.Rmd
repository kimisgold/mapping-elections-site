Ohio elected fourteen Democratic-Republicans to the Eighteenth Congress. Two of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson, ten of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, and two of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by William Crawford.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in several counties. Sandusky and Seneca counties were reported as one unit. The map reports the vote counts for both counties in Sandusky county.

Following the 1820 Census, Ohio gained eight seats in the House of Representatives.

Ohio used a district system for electing members to Congress.
