North Carolina elected five Federalists and five Democratic-Republicans to the Seventh Congress.

North Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1801, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nc.uscongress8.specialelection.1801) was held in which Democratic-Republican Charles Johnson was elected to replace David Stone, who was selected to the U.S. Senate.
