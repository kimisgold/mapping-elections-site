Ohio elected one Democratic-Republican to the Tenth Congress. The Republican faction in this election was the Tertium Quids (or just Quids), a coalition of Federalists and moderate Democratic-Republicans.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in some areas.

Ohio used a statewide at-large method for electing a member to Congress.
