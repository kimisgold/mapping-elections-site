Maryland elected three Federalists and five Democratic-Republicans to the Seventh Congress.

Maryland used a district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1802, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:md.uscongress2.special.1802) was held in which Walter Bowie was elected to replace Richard Sprigg, who had resigned from office.
