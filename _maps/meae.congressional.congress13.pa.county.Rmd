Pennsylvania elected one Federalist and twenty-two Democratic-Republicans to the Thirteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in a few counties.

Following the 1810 Census, Pennsylvania gained five more seats in the House of Representatives.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 1, which elected four members, and Districts 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10, which each elected two members. The votes cast in Warren County are included in the Venango County totals.
