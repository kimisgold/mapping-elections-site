New Hampshire elected four Federalists to the Sixth Congress.

New Hampshire used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.

In November 1799, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nh.uscongress.special.1799) was held in which Federalist James Sheafe was elected to replace Federalist Peleg Sprague, who had resigned from office.

In [August 1800](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nh.uscongress.special.1800) and [October 1800](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nh.uscongress.special.2.1800), two special elections were held in which Federalist Samuel Tenney was elected to replace Federalist William Gordon, who had resigned from office.
