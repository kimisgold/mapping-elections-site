Indiana elected three Democratic-Republicans to the Eighteenth Congress. Two of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson.

Following the 1820 Census, Indiana gained 2 more seats in the House of Representatives.

For the first time, Indiana used a district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1824, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:in.usrepresentative.1st.special.1824) was held in which Jacob Call was elected to replace William Prince, who had died.
