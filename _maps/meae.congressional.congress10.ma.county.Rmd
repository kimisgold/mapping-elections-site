Massachusetts elected six Federalists and eleven Democratic-Republicans to the Tenth Congress.

Massachusetts used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1807, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.berkshire.special.1807) was held in which Ezekiel Bacon was elected to replace Barnabas Bidwell, who had resigned from office.

In 1808, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.essexsouth.special.1808) was held in which Joseph Story was elected to replace Jacob Crowninshield, who died while in office.
