Pennsylvania elected one Federalist and seventeen Democratic-Republicans to the Ninth Congress.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 4, which elected two members, and Districts 1, 2, and 3, which each elected three members. The votes cast in Erie, Mercer, Venango, and Warren counties are included in the Crawford County totals. 

In 1805, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:pa.uscongress4.specialelection.1805) was held in which Democratic-Republican Robert Whitehill was elected to replace J. A. Hanna, who died while in office.

In 1805, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:pa.uscongress11.specialelection.1805) was held in which Democratic-Republican Samuel Smith was elected to replace John B. C. Lucas, who had resigned from office.

In 1806, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:pa.uscongress1.specialelection.1806) was held in which Democratic-Republican John Porter was elected to replace Michael Leib, who had resigned from office.
