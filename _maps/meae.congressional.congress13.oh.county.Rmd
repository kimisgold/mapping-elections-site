Ohio elected one Federalist and five Democratic-Republican to the Thirteenth Congress. 

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Following the 1810 Census, Ohio gained five more seats in the House of Representatives. 

For the first time, Ohio used a district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1813, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:oh.ushouseofrepresentatives.3.special.1813) was held in which William Creighton was elected to replace Duncan MacArthur, who had resigned. 

In 1813, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:oh.ushouseofrepresentatives.6.special.1813) was held in which Reasin Beall was elected to replace John S. Edward, who had died. 

In 1814, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:oh.uscongress6.special.1814) was held in which David Clendenin was elected to replace Reasin Beall, who had resigned.
