Tennessee elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Fourteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the county level.

Tennessee used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1815, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:tn.special.congress.2.1815) was held in which William G. Blount was elected to replace John Sevier, who had died.
