South Carolina elected two Federalists and six Democratic-Republicans to the Eighth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the parish or district level.

Following the 1800 Census, South Carolina gained two seats in the House of Representatives.

South Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress.
