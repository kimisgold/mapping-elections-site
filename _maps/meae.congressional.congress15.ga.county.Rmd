Georgia elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Fifteenth Congress.

Georgia used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.

In a January 1819 [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ga.uscongress.special1.1819), Robert Raymond Reid was elected to serve for the remainder of the 15th Congress in place of John Forsyth, who had resigned from office.
