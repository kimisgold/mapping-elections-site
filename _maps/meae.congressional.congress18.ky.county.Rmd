Kentucky elected twelve Democratic-Republicans to the Eighteenth Congress. Eight of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, and four of those Democratic-Republicans was part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Following the 1820 Census, Kentucky gained 2 seats in the House of Representatives.

Kentucky used a district system for electing members to Congress.
