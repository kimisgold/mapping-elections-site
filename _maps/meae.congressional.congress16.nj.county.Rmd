New Jersey elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Sixteenth Congress.

New Jersey used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1820, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nj.congress.special.1820) was held in which Charles Kinsey was elected to replace John Condit, who had resigned from office.
