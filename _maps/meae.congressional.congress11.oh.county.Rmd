Ohio elected a Republican who was part of a faction within the party to the Eleventh Congress. The Republican faction in this election was the Tertium Quids (or just Quids), a coalition of Federalists and moderate Democratic-Republicans.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Ohio used a statewide at-large method for electing a member to Congress.
