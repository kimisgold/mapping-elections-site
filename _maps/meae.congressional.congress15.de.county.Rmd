Delaware elected one Federalist and one Democratic-Republican to the Fifteenth Congress.

Delaware used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress. Delaware’s election law required that voters select two candidates, with one residing in the voter’s own county, and the other residing in one of the state's other two counties. Two at-large winners were elected.
