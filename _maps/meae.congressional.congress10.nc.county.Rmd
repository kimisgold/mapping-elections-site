North Carolina elected one Federalist and eleven Democratic-Republicans to the Tenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the county level.

North Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress.

The election results in District 7 were contested and Congress ordered the seat vacated.

In 1808, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.essexsouth.special.1808) was held in which Federalist John Culpeper was elected to fill the seat in District 7.
