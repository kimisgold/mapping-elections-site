New Jersey elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Seventeenth Congress.

New Jersey used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1821, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nj.uscongress.special.1821) was held in which Lewis Condict was elected to replace John Linn, who had died.
