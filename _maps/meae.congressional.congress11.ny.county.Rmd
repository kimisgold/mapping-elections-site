New York elected eight Federalists and nine Democratic-Republicans to the Eleventh Congress. 

New York used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except Districts 2 and 6, which each elected two members.

In 1810, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ny.specialuscongress.2.1810) was held in which Democratic-Republican Samuel L. Mitchell was elected to replace William Denning, who had resigned from office.
