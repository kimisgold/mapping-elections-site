Vermont elected five Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Four of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Vermont switched back to a district system for electing members to Congress.
