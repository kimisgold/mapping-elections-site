New Hampshire elected five Democratic-Republicans to the Eighteenth Congress. All five of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay.

New Hampshire used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress. New Hampshire was apportioned one less seat in the House of Representatives.
