South Carolina elected two Federalists and four Democratic-Republicans to the Fourth Congress.

Many returns are missing from this election.

In January 1795, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.specialelection.1795) was held in which Wade Hampton was elected to replace John Barnwell, who had been elected but declined to serve. Wade Hampton is included in the table below.
