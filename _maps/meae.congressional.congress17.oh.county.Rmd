Ohio elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Seventeenth Congress. 

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Ohio used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1821, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:oh.uscongress4.1821) was held in which David Chambers was elected to replace John C. Wright, who had resigned before Congress began their session.
