North Carolina elected four Federalists and nine Democratic-Republicans to the Thirteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the county level.

Following the 1810 Census, North Carolina gained one more seat in the House of Representatives.

North Carolina used a district system for electing members to Congress.
