South Carolina elected eight Democratic-Republicans to the Eleventh Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in many areas.

South Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1811, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.charleston.specialelection.1811) was held in which Langdon Cheves was elected to replace Robert Marion, who had resigned from office.
