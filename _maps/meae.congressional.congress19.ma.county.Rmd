Massachusetts elected three Federalists and four Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Three of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. In addition, five dissenting Federalists supported Adams and Clay, while one dissenting Federalist supported Andrew Jackson. As the Federalist Party declined in Massachusetts, many Federalists distanced themselves from the main party. Instead, their political affiliation more closely aligned with their choice of candidate for the 1824 presidential election.

Massachusetts used a district system for electing members to Congress.
