Connecticut elected seven Federalists to the Eighth Congress.

Mapping this election is not possible because of the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Connecticut used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.

In 1803, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.uscongress.1803) was held in which Federalist Simeon Baldwin was elected to replace Elias Perkins, who had resigned before the 8th Congress convened.
