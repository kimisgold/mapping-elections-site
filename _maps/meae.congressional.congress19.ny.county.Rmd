New York elected thirty-four Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Twenty-four of the Democratic-Republicans were part of an identifiable faction within the party. In New York, some candidates ran as Clintonians who supported internal improvements and soft money. 

New York used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress, except Districts 20 and 26, which each elected two members, and District 3, which elected three members.
