Louisiana elected one Democratic-Republican to the Fifteenth Congress.

Louisiana used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1818, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:la.uscongress.1818) was held in which Thomas Butler was elected to replace Thomas B. Robertson, who had resigned.
