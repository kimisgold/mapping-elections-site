Delaware elected two Federalist to the Thirteenth Congress.

Following the 1810 Census, Delaware gained one more seat in the House of Representatives.

Delaware used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress. Delaware’s election law required that voters select two candidates, with one residing in the voter’s own county, and the other residing in one of the state's other two counties. Two at-large winners were elected.
