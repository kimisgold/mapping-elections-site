South Carolina elected eight Democratic-Republicans to the Ninth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the parish or district level.

South Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1805, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.pendleton.1805) was held in which Democratic-Republican Elias Earle was elected to replace John B. Earle, who had resigned before the 9th Congress convened.
