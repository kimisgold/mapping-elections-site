North Carolina elected four Federalists and nine Democratic-Republicans to the Sixteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in many counties.

North Carolina used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1821, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nc.uscongress4.special.1821) was held in which William S. Blackledge was elected to replace Jesse Slocumb, who had died.
