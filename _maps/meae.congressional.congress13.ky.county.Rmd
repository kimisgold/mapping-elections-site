Kentucky elected ten Democratic-Republicans to the Thirteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Following the 1810 Census, Kentucky gained four seats in the House of Representatives.

Kentucky used a district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1813, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ky.uscongress8.special.1813) was held in which Stephen Ormsby was elected to replace John Simpson, a member-elect who had died. 

In 1814, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ky.specialelectionuscongress2.1814) was held in which Joseph H. Hawkins was elected to replace Henry Clay, who resigned from office after being appointed minister to Great Britain.
