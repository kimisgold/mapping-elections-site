Ohio elected six Democratic-Republican to the Fourteenth Congress. 

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in many areas.

Ohio used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1816, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:oh.uscongress1.vacancy.1816) was held in which William H. Harrison was elected to replace John McLean, who had resigned.
