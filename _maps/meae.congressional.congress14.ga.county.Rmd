Georgia elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Fourteenth Congress.

Georgia used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.

In 1816, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ga.specialuscongress.1816) was held in which Zadock Cook was elected to replace Alfred Cuthbert, who had resigned from office.
