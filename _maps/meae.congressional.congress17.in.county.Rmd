Indiana elected one Democratic-Republican to the Seventeenth Congress. 

Indiana used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.

In 1822, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:in.uscongress.special.1822) was held in which Jonathan Jennings was elected to replace William Hendricks, who had resigned from office to become Indiana's Governor.
