In its first congressional election, Tennessee elected one Democratic-Republican to the Fourth Congress. Andrew Jackson was seated for the second session of that Congress.

Tennessee used a statewide at-large system for electing its members to Congress. Votes were reported within administrative districts that contained several counties.
