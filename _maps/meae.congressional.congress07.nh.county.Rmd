New Hampshire elected four Federalists to the Seventh Congress.

New Hampshire used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.

In 1802, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nh.uscongress.special.1802) was held in which Samuel Hunt was elected to replace Joseph Pierce, who had resigned from office.
