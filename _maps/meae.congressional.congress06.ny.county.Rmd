New York elected four Federalists and six Democratic-Republicans to the Sixth Congress.

New York used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In December 1799, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ny.specialuscongress1.1799) was held in which Democratic-Republican John Smith was elected to replace Jonathan N. Havens, who died in office.
