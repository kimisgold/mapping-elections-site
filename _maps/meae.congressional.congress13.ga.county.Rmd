Georgia elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Thirteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns for Twiggs County.

Following the 1810 Census, Georgia gained two more seats in the House of Representatives.

Georgia used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.

In 1813, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ga.uscongress.special.1813) was held in which Alfred Cuthbert was elected to replace William W. Bibb, who had resigned from office.
