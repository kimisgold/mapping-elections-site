Massachusetts elected eighteen Federalists and two Democratic-Republicans to the Fourteenth Congress.

Massachusetts used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1815, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.essexnorth.special.1815) was held in which Jeremiah Nelson was elected to replace Daniel A. White, who had resigned. 

In 1816, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.worcestersouth.special.1816) was held in which Benjamin Adams was elected to replace Elijah Brigham, who had died.
