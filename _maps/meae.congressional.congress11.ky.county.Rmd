Kentucky elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Eleventh Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Kentucky used a district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1810, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ky.uscongress5.special.1810) was held in which W. T. Barry was elected to replace Benjamin Howard, who had resigned his office.
