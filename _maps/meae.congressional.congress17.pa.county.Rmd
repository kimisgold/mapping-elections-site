Pennsylvania elected eleven Federalists and twelve Democratic-Republicans to the Seventeenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 1, which elected four members, and Districts 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10, which each elected two members. The votes cast in Potter and McKean counties are included in the Lycoming County totals.
