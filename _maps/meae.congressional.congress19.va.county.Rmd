Virginia elected twenty-two Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Fourteen of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson, and seven of the Democratic-Republicans was part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in several counties.

Virginia used a district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1826, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:va.congress.5.special.1826) was held in which George W. Crump was elected to replace John Randolph, who had resigned after being appointed to the United States Senate.
