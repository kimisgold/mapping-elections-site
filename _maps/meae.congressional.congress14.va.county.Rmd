Virginia elected six Federalist and seventeen Democratic-Republicans to the Fourteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in several counties.

Virginia used a district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1815, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:va.uscongress.15.special.1815) was held in which John W. Kerr was elected to replace Mathew Clay, who had died before the Fourteenth Congress began.

In 1816, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:va.special.uscongress.18.1816) was held in which Thomas M. Nelson was elected to replace Thomas Gholson, who had died.

In 1816, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:va.uscongress.23.special.1816) was held in which John Tyler was elected to replace John Clopton, Sr., who had died.
