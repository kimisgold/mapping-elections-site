Louisiana elected three Democratic-Republicans to the Eighteenth Congress. Two of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, and the other Democratic-Republican was part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson.

Following the 1820 Census, Louisiana gained two seats in the House of Representatives.

For the first time, Louisiana used a district system for electing members to Congress.
