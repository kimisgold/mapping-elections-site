New York elected nineteen Federalists and eight Democratic-Republicans to the Thirteenth Congress.

Following the 1810 Census, New York gained ten more seats in the House of Representatives.

New York used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress, except Districts 1, 2, 12, 15, 20, and 21, which each elected two members.
