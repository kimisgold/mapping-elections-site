Pennsylvania elected eighteen Democratic-Republicans to the Eighth Congress.

Following the 1800 Census, Pennsylvania gained five seats in the House of Representatives.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 4, which elected two members, and Districts 1, 2, and 3, which each elected three members.

In 1804, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:pa.uscongress10.specialelection.1804) was held in which John Hoge was elected to replace William Hoge, who had resigned from office.
