Ohio elected fourteen Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Two of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson, and twelve of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Ohio used a district system for electing members to Congress.
