Pennsylvania elected five Federalists and eighteen Democratic-Republicans to the Fifteenth Congress. Three of the Republicans elected were members of an identifiable faction within the party. In Pennsylvania some candidates ran as Old School or New School Republicans, and were divided by disputes over banking, credit, and paper currency.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns for several counties.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 1, which elected four members, and Districts 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10, which each elected two members. The votes cast in Warren County are included in the Venango County totals. The votes cast in Jefferson County are included in the Indiana County totals.
