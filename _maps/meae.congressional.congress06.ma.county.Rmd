Massachusetts elected twelve Federalists and two Democratic-Republicans to the Sixth Congress.

Massachusetts used the district system for electing members to Congress.

On [August 25, 1800](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.middle.3.special.1800), and [October 20, 1800](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.middle.3.special.ballot2.1800), two special elections were held in which Federalist Nathan Read was elected to replace Samuel Sewall, who had resigned from office on January 10, 1800.

In 1800, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.western.3.special.1800) was held in which Federalist Ebenezer Mattoon was elected to replace Federalist Samuel Lyman, who had resigned from office on November 6, 1800.

Starting in August 1800, three special elections were held after which Democratic-Republican Levi Lincoln replaced Federalist Dwight Foster (listed as "Samuel Foster" in _A New Nation Votes_), who had resigned from the House of Representatives to replace Federalist Samuel Dexter in the Senate: [special election 1](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.western.4.special.1800),
[special election 2](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.western.4.special.ballot2.1800), [special election 3](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ma.uscongress.western.4.special.ballot3.1800).
