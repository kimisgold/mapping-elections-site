Pennsylvania elected one Federalist and twenty-five Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Seventeen of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson and three of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. 

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns for some counties.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except Districts 4 and 9, which each elected three members, and Districts 7, 8, 11, and 16, which each elected two members.
