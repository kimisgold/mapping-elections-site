Alabama elected three Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. All three of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson. 

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in many areas.

Alabama used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.
