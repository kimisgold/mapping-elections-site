New Hampshire elected five Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Two of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, and one was part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson. 

New Hampshire used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.
