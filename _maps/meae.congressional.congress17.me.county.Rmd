Maine elected two Federalists and five Democratic-Republican to the Seventeenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Maine used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1822, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:me.uscongress2.1822) was held in which Mark Harris was elected to replace Ezekial Whitman, who had resigned from office.
