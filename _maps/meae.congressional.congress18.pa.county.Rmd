Pennsylvania elected eight Federalists and eighteen Democratic-Republicans to the Eighteenth Congress. 

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns for some counties.

Following the 1820 Census, Pennsylvania gained three more seats in the House of Representatives.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except Districts 4 and 9, which each elected three members, and Districts 7, 8, 11, and 16, which each elected two members. The votes cast in Lycoming, Potter, and McKean counties were reported as one unit. 

In 1824, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:pa.congress.8.special.1824) was held in which George Wolf was elected to replace Thomas J. Rogers, who had resigned from office.

In 1824, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:pa.congress.13.special.1824) was held in which Alexander Thomson was elected to replace John Tod, who had resigned from office.
