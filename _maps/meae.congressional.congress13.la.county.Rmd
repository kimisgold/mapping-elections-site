Louisiana elected one Democratic-Republican to the Thirteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or parish level.

Louisiana used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress. 

In an October 1812 [special election](<https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:la.uscongress12thspecial.1812>), Thomas B. Robertson was also elected to serve in the lame duck 12th Congress.
