New Hampshire elected three Federalists to the Fifth Congress.

Mapping this election is not possible because of the lack of returns at the town or county level.
 
New Hampshire used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.

In November 1797, New Hampshire held a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nh.uscongress.special.1797), which went to a [second ballot](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nh.uscongress.special.2.1797), in which Peleg Sprague was elected to replace Jeremiah Smith, who resigned.
