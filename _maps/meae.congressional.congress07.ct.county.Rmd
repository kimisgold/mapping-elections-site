Connecticut elected seven Federalists to the Seventh Congress.

Mapping this election is not possible because of the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Connecticut used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.

In April 1801, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.uscongress.special.1801) was held in which Federalist Calvin Goddard was elected to replace Elizur Goodrich, who had resigned from office.

In September 1801, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.uscongress.special.1.1801) was held in which Benjamin Talmadge was elected to replace William Edmond, who had resigned from office.
