Maryland elected three Federalists and six Democratic-Republicans to the Tenth Congress. The dissenting Republicans who ran in districts 5 and 8 were Tertium Quids.

Maryland used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 5, which elected two members.
