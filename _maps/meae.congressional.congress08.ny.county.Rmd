New York elected five Federalists and twelve Democratic-Republicans to the Eighth Congress.

Following the 1800 Census, New York gained seven seats in the House of Representatives.

New York used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1803, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ny.specialuscongress6.1803) was held in which Daniel C. Verplanck was elected to replace Isaac Bloom, who died while in office.

In 1804, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ny.uscongress1.special.1804) was held in which Samuel Riker was elected to replace Democratic-Republican John Smith, who had resigned from office on February 23, 1804.
