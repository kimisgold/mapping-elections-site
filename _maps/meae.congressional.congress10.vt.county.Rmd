Vermont elected two Federalists and two Democratic-Republicans to the Tenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Vermont used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1808, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:vt.uscongress.southwest.special.1808) was held in which Democrat Samuel Shaw was elected to replace James Witherell, who had resigned from office.
