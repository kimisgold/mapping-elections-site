Connecticut elected seven Federalists to the Eleventh Congress.

Mapping this election is not possible because of the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Connecticut used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.

In 1810, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.special.congress.1810) was held in which Ebenezer Huntington was elected to replace Samuel Dana, who was appointed as an U.S. Senator.
