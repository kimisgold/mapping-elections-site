Maryland elected three Federalists and six Democratic-Republicans to the Eleventh Congress. 

Maryland used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 5, which elected two members.

In 1810, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:md.uscongress4.special.1810) was held in which Samuel Ringgold was elected to replace Roger Nelson, who had resigned. 

In November 1810, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:md.uscongress7.special.1810) was held in which Robert Wright was elected to replace John Brown, who had resigned. Since Brown had already been re-elected to the Twelfth Congress, this single ballot elected Wright to serve in Brownâ€™s place for the remainder of the Eleventh Congress, and for the Twelfth Congress.
