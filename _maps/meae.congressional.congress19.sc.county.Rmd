South Carolina elected nine Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Eight of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson, and the other Democratic-Republican was part of a faction led by William Crawford.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in some areas.

South Carolina used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1825, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.special.charleston.1825) was held in which William Drayton was elected to replace Joel R. Poinsett, who had resigned.
