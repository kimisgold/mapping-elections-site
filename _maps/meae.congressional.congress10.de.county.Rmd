Delaware elected one Federalist to the Tenth Congress.

Delaware used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress. Delaware’s election law required that voters select two candidates, with one residing in the voter’s own county, and the other residing in one of the state's other two counties. The at-large winner was then declared the winner.  This map depicts the initial winner.

In 1807, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:de.uscongress.1807) was held in which Federalist Nicholas Van Dyke was elected to replace James M. Broom, who had resigned from office.
