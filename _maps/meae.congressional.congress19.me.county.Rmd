Maine elected seven Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Five of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. 

Maine used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1826, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:me.uscongress5.second.1826) was held in which James W. Ripley was elected to replace Enoch Lincoln, who had been elected Governor of Maine.
