South Carolina elected nine Democratic-Republicans to the Fifteenth Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in some areas.

South Carolina used a district system for electing members to Congress. 

In 1818, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.edgefield.special.1818) was held in which Eldred Simkins was elected to replace John C. Calhoun, who had resigned after being appointed Secretary of War.
