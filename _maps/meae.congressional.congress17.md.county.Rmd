Maryland elected four Federalists and five Democratic-Republicans to the Seventeenth Congress. In the 8th district, Thomas Bayly, although listed as a Federalist, received support from both parties.

Maryland used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 5, which elected two members.

In 1823, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:md.uscongress5.special.17thcongress.1823) was held in which Isaac MacKim was elected to the Seventeenth Congress to replace Samuel Smith, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate.
