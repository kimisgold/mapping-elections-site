Missouri elected one Democratic-Republican to the Nineteenth Congress. The Democratic-Republican was part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Missouri used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.
