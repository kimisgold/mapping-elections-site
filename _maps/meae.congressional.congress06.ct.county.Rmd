Connecticut elected seven Federalists to the Sixth Congress.

Mapping this election is not possible because of the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Connecticut used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.

In October 1799, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.special.congress.1799) was held in which Federalist Elizur Goodrich was elected to replace Federalist John Allen, who declined to serve.

In October 1800, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.special.congress.1800) was held in which John Smith was elected to replace Federalist Jonathan Brace, who had resigned from office.
