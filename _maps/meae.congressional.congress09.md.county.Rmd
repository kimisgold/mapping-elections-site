Maryland elected three Federalists and six Democratic-Republicans to the Ninth Congress.

Maryland used a district system for electing members to Congress. Each district elected one member of Congress except District 5, which elected two members.

In 1806, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:md.uscongress7.special.1806) was held in which Edward Lloyd was elected to replace Joseph H. Nicholson, who had resigned from office.
