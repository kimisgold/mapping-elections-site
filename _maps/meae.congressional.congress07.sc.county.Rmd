South Carolina elected four Federalists and two Democratic-Republicans to the Seventh Congress.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the parish or district level.

South Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1802, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.camden.special.1802) was held in which Richard Winn was elected to replace Democratic-Republican Thomas Sumter. Richard Winn ran as a Federalist against Thomas Sumter in 1800 but ran as a Democratic-Republican for his successful reelection in 1803.
