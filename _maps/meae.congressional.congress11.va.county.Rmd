Virginia elected six Federalist, fifteen Democratic-Republicans, and one Republican who was part of a faction within the party to the Eleventh Congress. The dissenting Republican in this election was a Tertium Quid (or just Quid), a coalition of Federalists and moderate Democratic-Republicans.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in several counties.

Virginia used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In 1809, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:va.uscongress.21.special.1809) was held in which David S. Garland was elected to replace Wilson C. Nicholas, who had resigned from office.

In 1810, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:va.uscongress.1.special.1810) was held in which William MacKinley was elected to replace John G. Jackson, who had resigned from office.
