Tennessee elected nine Democratic-Republicans to the Eighteenth Congress. All nine of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns in a few areas.

Following the 1820 Census, Tennessee gained three seats in the House of Representatives.

Tennessee used a district system for electing members to Congress.
