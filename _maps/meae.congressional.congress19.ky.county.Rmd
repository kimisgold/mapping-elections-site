Kentucky elected twelve Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Seven of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, and five of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Kentucky used a district system for electing members to Congress.
