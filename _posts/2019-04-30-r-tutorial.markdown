Enjoyed looking at the maps featured on the *Mapping Early American
Elections* (MEAE) site? Wish you could utilize the MEAE dataset to make
your own maps, but are not sure how to get started? You're in luck! The
following tutorial will teach you how to combine MEAE data with
historical geospatial data to create basic choropleth maps (maps which
show geographic regions colored or shaded according to some variable) in
R. 

<!--more-->

While we are going to demonstrate how to make maps for Maryland's
First Congressional election, these steps can easily be replicated to
create maps for different Congressional elections and for different
states. By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned how to make a
map similar the MEAE map for [Maryland's 1st Congress](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress01.md.county.html).

<h2>Tutorial Overview and Goals</h2>

In this tutorial, we will be using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), an open-source programming
language used by data scientists, statisticians and other researchers
and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), an "integrated development environment" or application that helps one use R. We will use R to manipulate MEAE elections data for Maryland's
First US Congressional election and create two visualizations in the
form of choropleth maps. By the end of this tutorial you will have
learned how to:

-   Retrieve MEAE elections data for a selected state

-   Obtain historical spatial data for a selected state

-   Merge the MEAE elections data with the geospatial data for further analysis

-   Visualize this data geographically by creating choropleth maps of (1) party percentages and (2) an individual candidate's votes

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

This tutorial will assume that you already have set up R and R Studio,
and have a basic knowledge of how these tools work. (If not, R can be
downloaded [here](https://www.r-project.org/) and R Studio can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). An introduction to R from the Programming Historian can be found
[here](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/r-basics-with-tabular-data).)
We are using R and R Studio in this tutorial because both are widely
used, open-source tools that will allow us to manipulate and visualize
our data. Once setup is complete, open R Studio. We recommend creating a
new project, and setting up a working directory where you will store all
of your information for this tutorial. You will also want to create a
new R Markdown (RMD) file for this tutorial.

Next, you will need to install the packages and load the libraries that
are necessary for working with the MEAE data and geospatial data. You
only need to install a package once using the function `install.packages("package-name-here")` but you will need to load each package you want to use at the beginning of each R session with the function `library(package-name-here)`. If there are packages listed below that you have never installed before, go ahead and install them. Otherwise, use the `library()` function to load the packages listed
below.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(USAboundaries)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(scales)
library(leaflet)
```

<h2>About the Data</h2>

In this tutorial, we will be analyzing and visualizing MEAE data which
represents the election of six U.S. Congressmen from Maryland who made
up the state's delegation to the inaugural meeting the U.S. House of
Representatives in 1789.

In early America, and especially for the first Congress, U.S.
Congressional elections were quite experimental. Each state set its own
date for elections, and devised their own voting methods and procedures.
In Maryland, elections for the First Congress were held over the course
of a five-day period in January of 1789. Maryland used a combination of
an at-large and district voting system for the first Congress. The state
was divided into six residential districts. When voters went to the
polls, they cast a vote for six different candidates---each one having
to reside in a different district. At the end of the election, the votes
were tallied state-wide. The six candidates with the most total votes
across the state were elected, regardless of their residential district.
While political parties as we know them did not yet exist, the
candidates had split into two competing factions known as the Federalists
(in favor of Washington, Hamilton and the U.S. Constitution) and the
Anti-Federalists (who opposed the ratification of the U.S.
Constitution). In Maryland's First Congressional election, all six of
the winning candidates were affiliated with the Federalist faction.

The MEAE elections data we will be using in this tutorial, once
downloaded, is structured as two separate `.csv` files (which are like spreadsheets). The data
is recorded at the county level. The file `congressional-parties-meae.congressional.congress01.md.county.csv` ([download here](https://github.com/mapping-elections/elections-data/tree/master/congressional-parties-by-state)) has eighteen rows of
data and records the number of votes and percentage of vote received by
each "party" or faction in each of Maryland's eighteen counties.
The file `congressional-candidate-counties-meae.congressional.congress01.md.county.csv` ([download here](https://github.com/mapping-elections/elections-data/tree/master/congressional-candidate-counties-by-state))  has 324 rows of data, with each row showing the
number of votes a single candidate received in one of Maryland's
eighteen counties. We will look more closely at the elections data and
the variables in each file after we read the files into R Studio.

We will be joining our MEAE data to county-level historical spatial data
from the [USAboundries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/USAboundaries/index.html) R package, which draws its data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the [Atlas of Historical County Boundaries](https://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/).

<h2>Readying Elections Data for Analysis</h2>

<h3>Reading In the MEAE Data</h3>

First we start by loading the MEAE data into R Studio. The data needed
for this tutorial is available from the MEAE GitHub repository. The data for party results by county is stored in [this directory](https://github.com/mapping-elections/elections-data/tree/master/congressional-parties-by-state). You will want to select the `.csv` file for Maryland's First Congressional election.  You should also download the file for individual candidate results by county from [this directory](https://github.com/mapping-elections/elections-data/tree/master/congressional-candidate-counties-by-state), which you will use later in this tutorial. Once the data has be
been downloaded, move the two `.csv` files into your working directory.

Next, in R studio we will create a variable for our first type of data
(parties) and read in our data into the variable called
`md1_parties.` This is equivalent to opening our spreadsheet and
getting it into a format that R Studio can work with. We use the command
`stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to tell R to leave our data as strings of
characters instead of converting them into factors. This will help us
later when we go to join the MEAE data to the spatial data. Next, we
repeat this process with the candidates data, creating the variable
`md1_candidates`.

```
md1_parties <- read.csv(file = "congressional-parties-meae.congressional.congress01.md.county.csv", 
stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

md1_candidates <- read.csv(file = "congressional-candidate-counties-meae.congressional.congress01.md.county.csv",
stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
<br>
We should now have two data objects loaded that represent our two types
of MEAE data.

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-read-in-data.png) 

Let's take a closer look at both data objects to make sure that our data
was read in correctly, and that we understand the different variables
they contain. If you are working with R Studio, look at the Global
Environment window under the Environment tab in top right hand corner of
your screen. You should see the two data objects we created:
`md1_candidates` and `md1_parties`. Next to the name of each data
object, you should see a number of "obs." (observations) and a number of
variables. The number of observations corresponds with the number of
rows of data, while the number of variables corresponds to the number of
columns in the data. The data object `md1_candidates` should have 324 observations of
14 variables while `md1_parties` should have 18 observations of 27
variables. Clicking on the blue arrow beside the name of a data object
allows you to preview the variables and some of the observations.

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-preview-data.png) 

Clicking on the name of a data object in the Global Environment opens it
the Source Editor so that you can view or inspect all of the data. Open
`md1_parties` by clicking its name in the Global Environment. This should open a
spreadsheet-like view with a familiar column and row layout.

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-md1-parties.png) 

Let's take a closer look at the data in `md1_parties`. This data
object should contains data for the vote and percentage of the vote all
parties received in this election. The first variable (column) is called
`meae_id`. This variable contains a unique name that identifies this
election in the MEAE data. You will notice that all eighteen rows have
the same `meae_id`: `meae.congressional.congress01.md.county`. This
tells us that all the data here is county-level data from Maryland's
First U.S. Congressional election. The variables `county_ahcb` and
`county_fips` each contain a unique code for each county. Notice that
each row of data represents one of Maryland's eighteen counties. These
variables will be necessary when we join the MEAE data to the spatial
data.

Next, the variable `districts` gives information about the voting
procedures in a particular election. As mentioned above, Maryland used a
combination of an at-large and a district system. But to keep things
simple, this election is listed as "At-Large" because voters elected six
candidates that represented all voters of the state (instead of just a
district or subset). Finally, the last type of variable lists the total
number of votes (ex. `federalist_vote`) and percentage (
ex. `federalist_percentage`) of the vote achieved by each party or
faction. Notice that the data in the percentage columns is written as a
decimal with a range of zero to one. In Maryland's first Congressional
election, only the Federalist and Anti-Federalist factions received
votes. If you scroll to the right, you will see variables for other
parties and factions that did not participate in this election. The data
for these variables should appear as "NA."

Now, let's take a closer look at the data in `md1_candidates` by
clicking the data object's name in the Global Environment.

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-md1-candidates.png)

We notice that this data object contains data for all the candidates
that received votes in this election in Maryland. The first variable
(column) should look familiar: `meae_id`. From the next five variables 
We learn that this is a congressional election (U.S. House of Representatives) for the First Congress in the State of Maryland. The data is at given at the county level, and the election was conducted at the state level. Next, similar to the `meae_id`, the `election_id` is an unique name that identifies this election. You will notice that all 324 rows have the
same `election_id` "md.uscongress.1789", telling us that all of this
data represents the U.S. Congressional election taking place in Maryland
in 1789. Again, the `county_ahcb` and `county_fips` variables used
for joining this data to spatial data appear. The last four variables
represent the candidate's name, a unique ID for each candidate, the
party or faction the candidate represented in this election, and the
number of votes the candidate received in the county listed in that row.
For example, the first eighteen rows represent the votes that candidate
George Dent received in each of Maryland's eighteen counties.

<h3>Filtering for a Single Candidate's Votes</h3>

However in this tutorial, we are only going to map the vote totals for
one candidate at a time. Therefore, we will need to use the `filter()`
function so that we only receive returns for one candidate, instead of
for all eighteen candidates. We will need to select a variable to use to
filter our data. At first, we might consider using the variable
`candidate`, which gives the candidate's name. However, in early
America, spelling wasn't standardized. Sometimes the first or last name
of a candidate would be recorded differently in each county. Therefore,
it is better to `filter` by a variable called `candidate_id`. This is a unique code of
letters and numbers identifying each candidate in the MEAE dataset,
regardless of the spelling variations of his name. If we filtered using
a specific candidate's name, we might risk not obtaining all the data
for that candidate. But by filtering by the `candidate_id`, we make
sure we get all the data for a candidate.

Let's choose to filter our data so that we receive only results for the
Federalist candidate Joshua Seney, with a `candidate_id` of "SJ0183".
We use the code below to store the data for a single candidate in a new
variable `md1_single_candidate`, as we don't want to delete or
overwrite the data we have for all the candidates, in case we want to
make a map of a different candidate's votes later on. We specify that we
want to use the data from `md1_candidates` and then filter the data
so that the returns we get are only the rows where the `candidate_id`
is exactly equal (`==`) to `"SJ0183"`.

```
md1_single_candidate <- md1_candidates %>%
  filter(candidate_id == "SJ0183")
```
<br>
Double check that the new data object `md1_single_candidate` has
appeared in your Global Environment, and that it contains eighteen rows
of data, all for candidate Joshua Seney, with the `candidate_id` SJ0183.

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-md1-single-candidate.png)

At this point, you should have your data read in to R Studio as data
objects, filtered the candidates data to show results for a single
candidate, learned how to view or inspect your new data, and understand
what the variables and observations in this data represent.

<h2>Obtaining Spatial Data</h2>

While our MEAE data contains some geographic data (`county_ahcb` and
`county_fips`) that will be helpful for R to determine exactly what
counties we are talking about, we still need to obtain spatial data that
will help R draw Maryland's state and county boundaries as they appeared
in 1789---the year of the state's First U.S. Congressional election.
This type of historical spatial data can be found in the USAboundries
package. (This is one of the packages we installed and/or loaded at the
start of the tutorial.)

Because we would like to look at how votes for a particular candidate or
a party/faction differed between counties in Maryland, we need to obtain
county-level spatial data. We do this by using the command
`us_counties`. Because we know that Maryland's First Congressional
election took place in January 1789, but took place on a different day
of the month depending on the county, we set the map's date to the first
of the month. This ensures that we obtain spatial data that presents
each county's boundaries as they were just before this Congressional
election took place. We also specify that we would like high resolution
data, and that we are looking for county-level data for the state of
Maryland. We store this spatial data in `md1_counties`.

```
md1_counties <- us_counties(map_date = "1789-01-01",
                            resolution = "high", states = "MD")
```
<br>
A new data object of this name should be appear in your Global
Environment.

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-md1-counties.png)

Just like we did with the MEAE data, let's take a closer look at the
data in `md1_counties` by clicking on its name in the Global
Environment.

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-md1-counties-inspect.png)

Let's first look at the second through fifth variables. Compare the
observation in these columns to those in either of the MEAE data
objects. While the names of these new variable in `md1_counties` do
not exactly match what we've seen before, the observations they contain
should look familiar. The data in the new variable `name` matches the
data for the variable `county` in the MEAE data; the new variable
`id` matches the data from `county_ahcb`; the data in `fips`
matches that in `county_fips` and so on. Having data that is common
between our MEAE data and the spatial data will be key in joining the
data together later on.

Next, you'll see variables for `start_date`, `end_date`,
`change`, and `citation`. When we obtained our spatial data, we
stipulated that we wanted spatial data that represented Maryland
counties at a specific date. The `start_date` and `end_date` show
the date range for which the data provided is accurate. For example, the
geographic data and boundaries provided here for Frederick County would
be accurate from October 2, 1776 until January 18, 1836. The `change`
and `citation` variables give a reason for boundary or name change,
and give a source that this data comes from. Notice that many of these
counties were officially formed on July 4th, 1776 when the U.S. declared
its independence from Great Britain.

While we won't examine every variable in `md1_counties`, the last
variable `geometry` is the most important. This variable lists the
exact latitudinal and longitudinal data that creates an outline of each
county on a map. While it is important to inspect this data in the
Source Editor and make sure that there is data listed for each county
(row), it is almost impossible to tell if the data is accurate---i.e. if
it will actually produce a map of Maryland---just by looking at the
numbers. Instead, we can ask R to plot the data in the `geometry`
variable as a basic map. This will help us confirm that the data we have
is accurate. We will use R's basic graphing function (`plot`) to do
this. We identify that the data we want to plot is from
`md1_counties` and more specifically the variable `geometry`. We
also ask for `axes=TRUE` so that we can preview the latitude and
longitude data to place the map in a larger geographic context.

```
plot(md1_counties$geometry,axes=TRUE)
```
<br>
![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-md1-counties-plot.png)

Since the map that R produced looks like Maryland and contains eighteen
counties, we know that we have successfully retrieved accurate spatial
data.

<h2>Joining Elections Data with Geospatial Data</h2>

After we have read in and readied our MEAE data for parties and
candidates, and have obtained and stored our Maryland county-level data
for the January 1789, we need to combine or merge the elections data and
the spatial data. We do this by using the function `left_join`. A
join does just what it sounds like---it takes two data objects and joins
them together, producing a new data object.

A left join takes the data from your first data object, and looks for
matches in the second data object. If it finds a match, it adds the data
to the first data object. A left join will always return all the rows
from the first data object, even if there is no data that matches in the
second data object. Therefore, we will be using a `left_join`, with
`md1_counties` as the left/first data object, because we want the
resulting data object to retain the spatial data for each county, even
if there is no party data for a particular county to join to it.

<h3>Joining Parties Data to Spatial Data</h3>

Let's start building our function to join the data from
`md1_counties` and `md1_parties`. First we give a new name
`md1_counties_parties` to the data object that will result from this
join. Then we use the `left_join` function, and specify that the
left/first data object we want to use is `md1_counties`, followed by
the right/second data object `md1_parties`.

```
md1_counties_parties <- left_join(md1_counties, md1_parties)
```
<br>
However, we are not done yet. If you run this command, you will get an
error message telling you that "the data sources have no common
variables."

In order to execute a join, the two data objects you want to join must
share at least one variable in common. Without a common variable, R has
no way of knowing how the data in the two data objects go together.
Therefore, in our join function, we specify a variable that both data
objects have in common, and that we would like R to use to join the two
data object together. We use the argument `by =` to inform R what this
variable is.

As we noticed while inspecting our spatial data, our MEAE and spatial
data do have some variables in common. Nevertheless, R does not
recognize that they match because the variable names are slightly
different. For example, the variables `id` (in `md1_counties`) and
`county_ahcb` (in `md1_parties`) contain the same data in the form
of a county identification code with the same naming convention
(mds_countyname). Let's call this the "County ID." However, while the
data is the same, the names of the variables do not match. We can tell R
that these two variables---both representing the County ID---are in fact
the same by using `"id" = "county_ahcb"`. (The order here does
matter. The variable name used in the left/first data object must come
first, and the variable name used in the right/second data object must
come second.)

Let's put all this together in our `left_ join` function in order to
left join `md1_parties` (right/second) to `md1_counties`
(left/first) by the County ID (where `"id = county_ahcb"`). Go ahead
and run the function. Then make sure that your new data object
`md1_counties_parties` appears in your Global Environment. The
function we used is below.

```
md1_counties_parties <- left_join(md1_counties, md1_parties,
by=c("id" = "county_ahcb"))
```

<br>
Now that you have created `md1_counties_parties`, open it in the
Source Editor by clicking on its name in the Global Environment. We want
to inspect the data and make sure that the join worked correctly. At
first glance, your new data object should look very similar to
`md1_counties` with eighteen rows of data, one for each county.
However, if you scroll to the right, you should see that after the
variable `state_code`, the next variables are `meae_id`,
`county_fips`, `districts`, `federalist_vote`, etc. These are
all variables that were not a part of `md1_counties` and have been
placed here by the join.

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-md1-counties-parties.png)

Another way to check that the join worked correctly is to check the
number of observations and variables listed in the Global Environment.
The data object `md1_counties` has 21 variables while `md1_parties` has 27
variables. If we add the number of variables from the two original data
objects together and subtract one (to account for the one common
variable that was used to join the data) we get 47, the exact number of
variables that `md1_counties_parties` now contains.

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-md1-counties-parties-ge.png)

<h3>Joining Candidate Data to Spatial Data</h3>

Now that we have successfully joined our MEAE parties data and
county-level spatial data into `md1_counties_parties`, repeat the
steps above to join the MEAE candidates data with the county-level
spatial data to make `md1_counties_single_candidate`. This data
object should have 18 observation of 34 variables. The function we used
is below.

```
md1_counties_single_candidate <- left_join(md1_counties,
md1_single_candidate, by=c("id" = "county_ahcb"))
```
<br>

Congratulations! You have now successfully read-in all the MEAE data,
obtained the spatial data, and joined the data to create two new data
objects that each have elections and spatial data. We are now ready to
visualize our data by creating choropleth maps!

<h2>Visualizing: Maps</h2>

When creating geographic visualizations in R, you have many options.
There are several different packages and functions that you can use.
We've already used one of the most basic functions `plot()` to check our spatial
data earlier. For this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how to use
two different packages, `ggplot2` (part of the `tidyverse` package)
and `leaftlet` to make choropleth maps---maps which show geographic
regions colored or shaded according to some variable.

`ggplot2` creates simple, static maps that are quite customizable
directly in R. For additional information about using `ggplot2`, we
recommend looking at the package's [documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) or Kieran Healy's [*Data Visualization: A practical introduction*](https://socviz.co/index.html\#preface), especially Chapter 7 about maps.

`leaftlet` creates interactive maps that can be zoomed in and out, and
have click or hover-over labels. However, these maps are made with
JavaScript (another programing language) and are therefore a bit more
difficult to create in R. For additional information about using
`leaflet`, we recommend looking at the package's [documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html).

We recommending trying both kinds of maps and then deciding what works best
for you.

<h3>Mapping Party Percentages - ggplot2</h3>

First are going to make a `ggplot2` map that shows the percentage of
the vote received by the Federalist party/faction in each county during
Maryland's First Congressional election. We start our function
`ggplot()` by telling R that we want to work with the data object
`md1_counties_parties`, since this contains our spatial data and our
MEAE data for party percentages.

```
ggplot(md1_counties_parties)
```
<br>
Next, we need to add what is called a "geom" or geometry in `ggplot2`. You can think of this like telling R to create a layer of shapes or
dots. We will use `geom_sf` which provides several "simple features"
(sf) or tools to help manipulate spatial data. In our case, `geom_sf` will create outlines of each county in Maryland like we saw with our
earlier plot of the spatial data. Inside the `geom_sf` function, we
need to tell R what specific data from our data object
`md1_counties_parties` that we would like use to fill in each of
these county outlines. Because we want our each of counties to be filled
in with a gradient that shows the percentage of the vote received by the
Federalist party, we add `aes(fill = federalist_percentage)` to our
geom to tell R to pull data from the variable ` federalist_percentage`.

Finally, we have to tell R how to make the scale that will regulate the
shading or gradient. Here we are going to rely on
[ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org) which provides already made color schemes that are particularly suited to displaying values on maps. Here we use one of the four ColorBrewer functions that `ggplot2` recognizes: `scale_fill_distiller()`. We
use "fill" because we have (county) outlines that we want to fill in
(vs. "colour" which plots a single point on a graph) and "distiller"
because we have continuous numerical data (vs. "brewer" which plots
categorical data).

Within `scale_fill_distiller()` we can provide some additional
information to help R build our scale. We name the scale "Percent of
Vote." We specify that the color palette should be "Greens." (You can
use whatever color suits your fancy, but we have used "Greens" here
because MEAE uses green to represent the Federalist Party.) We tell R
that if there is no data available ("NA") for a county, the county
should be filled in with the color white. (Again, you could pick another
color here like grey if you want.) Next we specify the direction the
scale should go. Should the largest percentage of the vote be
represented by the darkest color or the lightest color? Since we want
the former, we use `direction = 1`. Finally, with `labels =` we
specify how we want the legend to look. We use `scales::percent` to
tell R that the data we are using should be displayed as percentages.
Now you are ready to run your code and create your first map. The code
we used is below.

```
ggplot(md1_counties_parties) +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = federalist_percentage)) + 
    scale_fill_distiller(name = "Percent of Vote", 
                         palette = "Greens", 
                         na.value = "white", 
                         direction = 1, 
                         labels = scales::percent) 
```

![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-parties-map1-fed-ggplot2.png)

Good job! You have just made you first choropleth map with MEAE
elections data. Now that the actual map part is created, you can play
around with other options to make your map presentation ready. In our
example below, we added a title and adjusted its size and alignment, we
took away the tick marks and text on both axes, and removed the grey
background and border around the map.

```
ggplot(md1_counties_parties) +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = federalist_percentage)) + 
    scale_fill_distiller(name = "Percent of Vote", 
                         palette = "Greens", 
                         na.value = "white", 
                         direction = 1, 
                         labels = scales::percent) + 
  labs(title ="Federalist Vote Percentage - MD1") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=14, hjust = 0.7),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),

<h3>Going Further with Party Percentages - ggplot2</h3>

Now that you have learned how to make a choropleth map in `ggplot2`
using `md1_counties_parties` to show the Federalist vote percentage,
you can use the same steps to make different kinds of party maps.

For example, you could create a map of the Anti-Federalist (instead of
Federalist) vote percentages by slightly modifying the above code:

1. change the variable name in the `geom_sf` from `federalist_percentage` to `antifederalist_percentage`

2. change the color of the palette in `scale_fill_distiller` to
something else. We recommend `"Oranges"`, as this is the color MEAE
uses to represent Anti-Federalists

3. change the title of map to something like `"Anti-Federalist Vote
Percentage - MD1"`

Here is the code we used and the map it produced.

```
ggplot(md1_counties_parties) +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = antifederalist_percentage)) + 
    scale_fill_distiller(name = "Percent of Vote", 
                         palette = "Oranges", 
                         na.value = "white", 
                         direction=1, 
                         labels = scales::percent) +
    labs(title="Anti-Federalist Vote Percentage - MD1") + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=14, hjust = 0.7),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank())
```


![]({{site.url}}/content-img/r-parties-map-antifed-ggplot2.png)

Or, you could create a map of Federalist vote totals (instead of
percentages) by slightly modifying the above code:

1. change the variable name in the `geom_sf` from `federalist_percentage` to `federalist_vote`

2. change the name of the scale from `"Percent of Vote"` to `"Votes"`

3. remove `labels = scales::percent`

4. change the title of map to something like `"Federalist Vote Totals - MD1"`

```
ggplot(md1_counties_parties) +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = federalist_vote)) + 
    scale_fill_distiller(name = "Votes", 
                         palette = "Greens", 
                         na.value = "white", 
                         direction = 1) + 
    labs(title ="Federalist Vote Totals - MD1") + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=14, hjust = 0.7),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank())
```

Of course, if you are using a state other than Maryland or a Congress
other than the First, the parties will be different, giving you a world
of possible maps to create.

<h3>Party Percentages - leaflet</h3>

Now we are going to create a `leaflet` map that shows the percentage
of the vote received by the Federalist party/faction in each county
during Maryland's First Congressional election. Unlike in `ggplot2`
where we could describe the color scale we wanted as a part of the
`ggplot` function, in `leaflet` we must start by creating a separate
function that tells leaflet how to create the scale we want. We store
this function as `federalist_percent_colors` and use the function
`colorNumeric` to tell `leaflet` that we want to create a color
scale based on numbers. We specify the palette we want to use is
`"Greens"`. (Again in MEAE, Federalists are represented by green, but
you can make this a color of your choosing.) Finally, we have to define
a domain for this scale. `leaflet` wants to know the lowest and highest
values (numbers) in our scale. Remember that we are mapping the
Federalist percentage of the vote and our votes percentages are stored
as decimals ranging from zero to one. Because of this, we use `domain = 0:1`.

```
federalist_percent_colors <- colorNumeric(palette = "Greens", domain = 0:1)
```
<br>
Now we are ready to create our mapping function. We start our function
`leaflet()` by telling R that we want to work with the data object
`md1_counties_parties`, since this contains our spatial data and our
MEAE data for party percentages. Then we use what is called a "pipe"
`%>%` to tell R to take what we have just inputed and use it in the
next line. You can think of it like the phrase "and then." On the next
line we are adding a layer to our map with the function
`addPolygons()`. So it is like saying "create a leaflet map with the
data `md1_counties_parties`, and then add Polygons."

In our case, `addPolygons()` will create outlines of each county in
Maryland, just like `geom_sf` did in `ggplot2`. Inside the
`addPolygons()` function, we need to give leaflet some more
information about how we would like to fill in each of these county
outlines. Because we want each of our counties to be filled in with a
color gradient based on the `federalist_percent_colors` function we
just created, we specify that the `fillColor = ~federalist_percent_colors(federalist_percentage)`. This tells leaflet to fill in the county outlines/polygons by using the function `federalist_percent_colors` and specifically, to use the data from the variable `federalist_percentage`. Next, we specify that we would like the `fillOpacity` (the transparency of the color filling the
outline) be to set to one. (0 is equivalent to fully transparent/no
color, and .5 is equivalent to 50% transparency.) Finally we can
describe our preferences for the polygons' outlines. We set the
`color` to `"black"` and the `weight` to 1. (A higher number for
the `weight` would result in a thicker outline, while a smaller number
would result in a thiner outline.) We can run the code below to make
sure that we have added our polygons correctly.

```
federalist_percent_colors <- colorNumeric(palette = "Greens", domain = 0:1)

leaflet(md1_counties_parties) %>% 
 addPolygons(fillColor = ~federalist_percent_colors(federalist_percentage),
             fillOpacity = 1,
             color = "black", 
             weight = 1)
```
<br>
Notice that this leaflet map is interactive instead of static. Try
dragging the map around or zooming in or out.

Great! Now that we have a map of Maryland with the counties filled in
with a green gradient, we need to add a legend to show what percentages
the fill colors correspond with. We use a `%>%` to tell leaflet that
we have more to add to our map. Then on the next line, we add an
additional layer for the legend with the function `addLegend()`. Then
we give leaflet the information it needs to build the legend. We specify
the `position` of the legend should be in `"bottomright"` corner of
our map. `pal` asks what colors it should use in the legend. We
specify that we want to use the color scale created in our function
`federalist_percent_colors`. We also tell it that the `values` are
coming from the variable `~federalist_percentage`. We give the
legend a title and set the `opacity` at 1 so that the legend is not
transparent. Finally, just like we told `ggplot` to display our data
as percentages (instead of in decimal form) with the command `labels = scales::percent`, here we instruct leaflet to do the same thing with
the command `labFormat = labelFormat(suffix = "%", transform = function(x) {x*100}`. This tells leaflet to transform the data by
multiplying it by 100 and then adding a percent sign to the end of the
number. The code we used to build our legend is below.

```
 addLegend(position = "bottomright", pal = federalist_percent_colors, 
    values = ~federalist_percentage,
    title = "Percentange of Vote", opacity = 1,
    labFormat = labelFormat(suffix = "%", transform = function(x) { x*100 })
```

<h3>Going Further with Party Percentages - leaflet</h3>

While a leaflet map can be more difficult to build, it also offers
extra, sometimes useful features such as a label when one hovers or
clicks on data. For example, we might want to add a label that would
appear when you hovered your mouse over each county, giving the county
name and the exact percentage of the vote received by the Federalist
party. We would do this by adding a line of code inside of our
`addPolygons()` function. We might use the code: `label = ~paste(name, " County,", (federalist_percentage*100),"%"))`.

In this code, `name` and `federalist_percentage` are two variables
from `md1_counties_parties` that gives the county name and percent
of the Federalist vote respectively. This means that when leaflet is
creating a label for each county, we want it to go find the data in the
`name` and `federalist_percentage` variables for that county and
paste it in the label. Remember that we have to multiply the data from the the `federalist_percentage` column by one hundred to transform it from a decimal to a percent. Finally, the word "county" and symbol "%" literally mean, paste the word county and the percent sign in each label.

The code below creates a leaflet map with all of the options we have
discussed. Notice that when you hover over county, you can now see the
county's name and the percent of the vote Federalist received in that
county.

```
federalist_percent_colors <- colorNumeric(palette = "Greens", domain = 0:1)

leaflet(md1_counties_parties) %>% 
 addPolygons(fillColor = ~federalist_percent_colors(federalist_percentage),
             fillOpacity = 1,
             color = "black", 
             weight = 1,
             label = ~paste(name, " County,", (federalist_percentage*100),"%")) %>%  
 addLegend(position = "bottomright", pal = federalist_percent_colors, 
    values = ~federalist_percentage,
    title = "Percentange of Vote", opacity = 1,
    labFormat = labelFormat(suffix = "%", transform = function(x) { x*100 }))
```

Bravo! You have successfully created choropleth maps of MEAE parties
data using two different packages, `ggplot2` and `leaflet`. You
could easily modify the code from either the `ggplot2` or `leaflet`
map to create your own choropleth maps the show the number of votes or
percentage of the vote for any of the states, elections or parties in
the MEAE dataset.

<h3>Mapping A Single Candidate's Votes</h3>

While we have now created maps that show the number of votes or
percentage of the vote received by a single party or faction, wouldn't
it be great to see how a particular candidate from that party faired in
the election? In what counties did a particular candidate do well? Where
did a candidate not do so well? We can now use the skills you learned building
maps of party percentages to do just that.

First, let's remind ourselves about the variables and observation in our
data object `md1_counties_single_candidate` (holding our MEAE
candidate data and spatial data) by opening it in the Source Editor.
Let's scroll over to the variables `candidate`, `candidate_id`, and
`vote`. Remember that we have filtered this data so the data object
only contains MEAE data for a single candidate, Joshua Seney, joined to
the spatial data. If you later desire to create a map that shows the
votes of a different candidate, you can do this by returning to the
beginning of you R Markdown file and replacing Joshua Seney's
`candidate_id` with that of your desired candidate in the
`filter()` function, and re-running all of your code, including your
spatial join code.

<h3>Mapping A Single Candidate's Votes - ggplot2</h3>

Now we can use what we learned while making a `ggplot2` party
percentage map to make a map that shows the number of votes received by
a single candidate. We can do this by slightly modifying the code we
created above. This time, we want to use
`md1_counties_single_candidate` as the data for our map by placing
it inside the `ggplot()` function. Next we want to use the variable
`vote` (representing the number of votes the candidate received) as
the `fill`. We name the scale `"Number of Votes"`, remove the
`labels = scales::percent` command, since we are dealing with votes
instead of percentages, and give the map a title like `"Votes for Federalist Joshua Seney - MD1"`. The code we used and map it created is below.

```
ggplot(md1_counties_single_candidate) +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = vote)) + 
    scale_fill_distiller(name = "Number of Votes", 
                         palette = "Greens", 
                         direction=1) +
    labs(title="Votes for Federalist Joshua Seney - MD1") + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=14, hjust = 0.7),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank())
```

Great job in creating yet another map with `ggplot2`! Notice that
Joshua Seney received more votes in the west than the east, even though
he is from Queen Ann's County on Maryland's Eastern Shore. You can tell
this, because the counties in the west should be shaded with a darker
green color. Also, notice that because this is an At-Large election
(meaning that candidates received votes in all counties), all eighteen
counties are filled in with some color. If this was a district election,
Joshua Seney would have only received votes in his own district, and
only the counties in his district would be colored in.

<h3>Mapping A Single Candidate's Votes - leaflet</h3>

Similarly, we can modify the leaflet code we used to create a party
percentage map in order to make a map that shows the number of votes
received by our single candidate, Joshua Seney.

The first change comes in the function that tells leaflet how to create
the color scale for our map. When we were creating a map of party
percentages, we specified a `domain` from zero to one because we
easily knew the lowest and highest values in the scale. In this case, we
are dealing with vote totals and we do not automatically know what are
the lowest and highest values. So in this case, we are going to let
ColorBrewer help us automatically create the best color scale based on
the data we have. Therefore, we define the `domain` as
`md1_counties_single_candidate$vote`, which tells leaflet the data
object, followed by the specific variable within that data object that
we want it to use to calculate the scale.

```
colors_candidate <- colorNumeric(palette = "Greens", 
                                 domain = md1_counties_single_candidate$vote)
```
<br>
Next, we'll make a few modifications to the leaflet code we used previously. This time, we
want to use `md1_counties_single_candidate` as the data for our map
by placing it inside the `leaflet()` function. Next we want to use our
function `colors_candidate` followed by the the variable `vote`
(representing the number of votes the candidate received) as the
`fillColor`. We change the table so that it uses the variables
`county` (for the county name), and `vote` (for the number of
votes). Finally, we adjust the legend so that `pal` uses our function
`colors_candidate`, the `values` are drawn from the variable
`vote`, the scale is called something like `"Number of Votes"`, and
we have removed the `labFormat` function, since no suffix or
transformation of the data is needed. The code and map we created is
below.

```
colors_candidate <- colorNumeric(palette = "Greens", 
                                 domain = md1_counties_single_candidate$vote)

leaflet(md1_counties_single_candidate) %>% 
  addPolygons(fillColor = ~colors_candidate(vote),
              fillOpacity = 1,
              color = "black", weight = 1,
              label = ~paste(county, " County:", vote, " votes")) %>% 
 addLegend(position = "bottomright", pal = colors_candidate, 
           values = ~vote, title = "Number of Votes", opacity = 1)
```

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Congratulations! You have accomplished a lot in this tutorial. Just
to recap, you've learned how to read-in and inspect our MEAE data,
how to obtain historical county-level spatial data, how to join the MEAE
data to the spatial data, how to create party percentage maps in gglopt2
and leaflet, and how to create a map of an individual candidate's votes
in gglopt2 and leaflet.

Most importantly, this tutorial should have provided you with a basic
template for taking MEAE data and using geospatial analysis to
analyze phenomenons such a candidate's votes, a party's votes, or a
party's percentage of the vote. However, this is just the beginning of
the possible kinds of maps or means of inquiry you can carry out using
the MEAE dataset. Using the methods outline above, you can continue to
investigate by creating choropleths with other variables, for other
Congresses, or for other states in the MEAE dataset.
