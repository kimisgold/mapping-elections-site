summary: "The <em>Mapping Elections</em> project turns records of electoral returns into maps of voting patterns."
abstract: "The historical records for the results of elections during the early American republic are scattered and fragmentary. After these election returns were gathered by the <em>A New Nation Votes</em> project, we turned them into a spatial dataset. Understanding this process will help scholars to interpret these maps and data."
